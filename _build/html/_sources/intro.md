# Welcome to Python World!

This is a series of lectures to give beginners a feel for how python programming is proceed.

## How to use this interactive lectures

**For beginners, installing Python in the machine is pretty hard. Here we provide both the 
tutorial for [setting up environments](install-anaconda) and an online interactive python
environment.**

### Download this page

### Launch the interactive environments
In order to run the code and learn by your own, you'd better to launch the interactive cells,
where the Python code are stored. You can find a cell [Here](lec-1.html#using-python-as-a-calculator).

Firstly, Open the lecture page, e.g., [Lecture 1](lec-1) and you would find
some buttons in the top of the page, click the {fa}`rocket` icon and choose {guiLabel}`Live Code`.

```
Then, the applications will start, you can see following information in the top of the page.
